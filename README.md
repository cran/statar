statar
======

statar makes it easier to work with tabular datasets. The package includes a set of functions to clean and summarize variables, to join datasets with an SQL-syntax, and to manipulate datasets with a panel
structure. statar is based on the data.table package and is inspired by Stata.

The first vignettes presents [summary functions](vignettes/summary.Rmd),  the second presents [panel data functions](vignettes/panel-data.Rmd), the third presents [fuzzy merges](vignettes/merge-records.Rmd),  the fourth presents [string and expression interpolation](vignettes/macros.Rmd).
